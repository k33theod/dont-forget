# dont-forget

This program acts as a reminder through messages, opening files, web pages and sending emails

The first you have to do is to change the given time entry to the time you want the action to take place !!!Do not change the time format
Second pick an action from file, message, webpage, email and fill the fields.
In normal the required action will spawn at the time you want

Calendar button just pops up a window with current year calendar

Actions are stored permanently in a shelve file and all run every time you open the programm if their execution time has passed, dont forget to push the clear old actions button to keep your reminder fresh with future actions only

In case the programm doesn't respond you can run it through python indle to get error messages, you can handle them or send me an email.

Some email providers doesn't allow "programms" to login and use email services for security reasons. If this is the case you normally get a warning to your email acount.

known bug ? : If you try to open more than on files from the same type and your default opening application doesnt support tabs you will get only the last one. The program wont create a new window instead will load the new file in aleady existing one.
